        <h4 class="AllTheFonts" id="T2">Who? Where? When was it discovered?</h4>
        <p>
        In 1787, a man called "Carl Arrhenius"<br> <img class="Pics" src="../images/axel_carpelan.jpeg" alt="Yttrium inventor">/><br>
came pass by an unusual black rock at Ytterby, near Stockholm in an old quarry. He thought he had found a new tungsten mineral but he actually found Yttrium and passed the specimen over to Johan Gadolin based in Finland. In 1794, Gadolin announced that it contained a new 'earth'. It was called an’ earth’ because it was yttrium oxide, Y2O3, which could not be reduced further by heating with charcoal.
        </p>
        <h4 class="AllTheFonts" id="T3">Some uses for it</h4>
<p>There are many uses for yttrium and here is some:</p> 
<br>
<p>It is used in lasers that can cut through metals.</p><br>
<img class="Pics" src="../images/Frame.jpeg" alt="Frame Yttrium"/>
<p>Yttrium oxide is to make glass for camera lenses to make them heat and shock resistance by adding yttarium oxide to the glass.</p><br>
<img class="Pics" src="../images/casio.jpg" alt="What it's used to make"/>
<p>The radioactive isotope yttrium-90 has medical uses. It can be used to treat some cancers, such as liver cancer.</p><br>
<p>Yttrium is often used as an extra reinforcements in alloys. It increases the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys.</p><br>
        <h5 class="AllTheFonts" id="T4">Some weird/bizare facts</h5>
        
        <P>Did you know that radars reflect the use of yttrium in radar technology lie how it is used to provide the red color <br> for early color TV screens such as the reason for the background which echoes the Warner Bros. ‘That’s all Folks!’ cartoon splash screen.<br>  
        Did you know that Yttrium is named after Ytterby, Sweden.<br>
        Did you know that Carl arrphenius found Yttarium but Johan Gadolin discovered yttarium.<br>
        Did you know that Yttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal.</P>
        
<h6 class="Fancy" id="T5">A small pun</h6>
<P class="Fancy">
A rare earth metal found in the deep earth <br>
The name is Yttrium shiny and bright <br>
I am so famous that i am on Tv <br>
